Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.


There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Heading 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. Codeberg is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Heading 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> > When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Heading 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require("./lang/" + l);
  return true;
};
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

1.  This is an ordered list following a header.
2.  This is an ordered list following a header.

###### Heading 6

## There's a horizontal rule below this.

---

## Here is an unordered list:

- Item foo
- Item bar
- Item baz
- Item zip

## And an ordered list:

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
4. Item four

## And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

## Here are checkboxes:

- [ ] Milk
- [x] Eggs
- [x] Flour
- [ ] Coffee
- [x] Combustible lemons

### Same but interactive

<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox"> Milk</li>
<li><input checked="" type="checkbox"> Eggs</li>
<li><input checked="" type="checkbox"> Flour</li>
<li><input type="checkbox"> Coffee</li>
<li><input checked="" type="checkbox"> Combustible lemons</li>
</ul>

### With radio type

<ul>
<li><input type="radio" name="test"> Milk</li>
<li><input type="radio" name="test"> Eggs</li>
<li><input type="radio" name="test"> Flour</li>
<li><input checked="" type="radio" name="test"> Coffee</li>
<li><input type="radio" name="test" disabled=""> Combustible lemons</li>
</ul>

## Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.

## Extra

Alright now that the generic (slightly extended) ~~Jekyll~~ Zola demo page have ended, we can get to the custom stuff, which believe me, is neat.

### Shortcodes

Duckquill provides a few useful [shortcodes](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/) that simplify some tasks.

#### Image

By default images come with styling, such as rounded corners and shadow. To fine-tune these, you can use shortcodes with different variable combinations.

Available variables are:

- `url`: URL to an image.
- `url_min`: URL to compressed version of an image, original can be opened by clicking on the image.
- `alt`: Alt text, same as if the text were inside square brackets in Markdown.
- `full`: Forces image/video to be full-width.
- `pixels`: Uses nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.
- `transparent`: Removes rounded corners and shadow, useful for transparent images.
- `no_hover`: Removes zoom on hover.

Variables should be comma-separated and be inside the brackets.

```jinja2
{{/* image(url="image.png", alt="This is an image" no_hover=true) */}}
```

{{ image(url="https://i1.theportalwiki.net/img/2/23/Ashpd_blueprint.jpg", alt="Portal Gun blueprint", no_hover=true) }}
<figcaption>Image with an alt text and without zoom on hover</figcaption>

{{ image(url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/JPEG_example_JPG_RIP_100.jpg", url_min="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/JPEG_example_JPG_RIP_010.jpg", alt="The gravestone of J.P.G.", no_hover=true) }}
<figcaption>Image with compressed version, an alt text, and without zoom on hover</figcaption>

Alternatively, you can append the following URL anchors. It can be more handy in some cases, e.g such images will render normally in any Markdown editor, opposed to the Zola shortcodes.

- `#full`: Forces image/video to be full-width.
- `#pixels`: Uses nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.
- `#transparent`: Removes rounded corners and shadow, useful for transparent images.
- `#no-hover`: Removes zoom on hover.

<figcaption>Full-width image with an alt text, pixel-art rendering, no shadow and rounded corners, and no zoom on hover</figcaption>

#### Video

Same as images, but with a few differences: `no_hover` and `url_min` are not available.

```jinja2
{{/* video(url="video.webm", alt="This is a video") */}}
```

{{ video(url="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.webm", alt="Red flower wakes up") }}
<figcaption>WebM video example from MDN</figcaption>

#### CRT

Alright, this one doesn't simplify anything, it just adds a CRT-like effect around Markdown code blocks.

```jinja2
{%/* crt() */%}
-> Markdown code block <-
{%/* end */%}
```

{% crt() %}

```

## Captions

Media can have additional text description using the `<figcaption>` HTML tag directly under it.

```markdown

<figcaption>The image caption</figcaption>
```

Quill and a parchment

</aside>

A quill is a writing tool made from a moulted flight feather (preferably a primary wing-feather) of a large bird. Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.

As with the earlier reed pen (and later dip pen), a quill has no internal ink reservoir and therefore needs to periodically be dipped into an inkwell during writing. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool anymore because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and would quickly wear a quill down. However it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who have noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.

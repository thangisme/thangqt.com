Hello there! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet.

I'm Thang, an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. I love open-source software and Linux in general. Becoming a full-time open-source developer/contributor is my goal. Besides computing, I enjoy listening to music 24 hours a day.

Currently, I'm learning DSA and Rust. I'm looking to get into Nix(OS) and (Neo)Vim soon.

title: Git push unexpectedly freezes my system

Yesterday, I was doing a minor update to my website. When it's time to push the update, I ran into a problem where my laptop completely froze when I ran `git push`.
I was confused and waited for a bit; Nothing happened. My laptop wasn't getting hot, the fan wasn't spinning, I couldn't even switch tty to atleast kill the process.
Still, I was running a couple program at the time, so I thought to myself it've must been other program causing the freese. Didn't think twice, I went ahead and force shut down
my laptop. When it booted up, I promptly opened the terminal and did a `git push` again. My laptop froze, again ...

That was really weird. I tried searching for similar problem but not a single one turned up. Again, I forced shutdown and booted it up. This time, I searched for error log in `journalctl`.
There was none, except some unrelated errors from `gdm` and `swaync`. However, just to make sure those are not interfering with git, I switched to a console tty and `git push` again.

To my surprise, it said something along the line of

```bash
Couldn't read response from /nix/store/.../x11-ssh-askpass
```

then promptly asked for my credential.
"Aha! It must have been cause by that askpass thingy" - I said to myself. It indeed was, as I naively switched back to normal working tty and run that askpass binary. It did caused the freeze again.
There goes another forced shut down...

There weren't much information on `x11-ssh-askpass` that I could find. I looked into the containing folder of the binary. There was another binary named `ssh-askpass`.
I was running Wayland so it's reasonable to think that the x11 version is the cause. Thus, I ran `ssh-askpass` to check. Nope, It f\*cking caused the freeze again.
Desperately, I tried looking for `ssh-askpass wayland` on Google. There were a few relevant results, with the top one point to this [post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/779264/how-do-i-get-ssh-askpass-working-in-wayland-on-kde).
The only answer suggested using `ksshaskpass` which I later knew that It was a alternative to `ssh-askpass` implemented for KWallet.

I'm a fan of KDE. However, I recently made the move to tiling wm and KDE apps need a lot of KDE dependencies; So I was using GDM and Gnome-keyring instead.
I then went ahead and looked for (Gnome) alternative to `ssh-askpass`. As guessed, `gnome-keyring` did have support for git authentication [[source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13385690/how-to-use-git-with-gnome-keyring-integration)].
On newer git version, It called `libsecret` and apparently it has to be manually compiled, atleast on major distro.
Naturally, I search for `git-credential-libsecret nixos`, after a bit, I found the official [Nix wiki on this](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Git). Below is what the wiki suggested:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  programs.git = {
    enable = true;
    extraConfig = {
      credential.helper = "${
          pkgs.git.override { withLibsecret = true; }
        }/bin/git-credential-libsecret";
    };
  };
}
```

Needless to say, I was excited and ready to take a break. It saddened me to see my laptop hang again after deploying the fix. I was feeling impatiently already.

I dig a little deeper on Google and finally found the [related offical Git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials). As suggested on the page, I ran below command to list available auth helper:

```bash
git help -a | grep credential-
```

The `libsecret` helper didn't show up. It baffled me that the official solution by the Nix wiki didn't work.
Looking for other search results, I came into [this thread](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/git-credential-manager-on-nixos/25742/4) on NixOS forum.
[This answer](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/git-credential-manager-on-nixos/25742/6) suggested that the official solution was outdated. So in the end, I tried the config the answer gave

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  programs.git = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.gitFull;
    extraConfig = {
      credential.helper = "libsecret";
    };
  };
}
```

After deploying, I ran above mentioned command to list available helper again.
There was it - `credential-libsecret`. Hopping for this to work, I ran `git push`.

No, I didn't.

Back to the git docs, there was this:

```
Without any credential helpers defined, Git will try the following strategies to ask the user for usernames and passwords:
  If the GIT_ASKPASS environment variable is set, the program specified by the variable is invoked. A suitable prompt is provided to the program on the command line, and the userâ€™s input is read from its standard output.
  Otherwise, if the core.askPass configuration variable is set, its value is used as above.
  Otherwise, if the SSH_ASKPASS environment variable is set, its value is used as above.
  Otherwise, the user is prompted on the terminal.
```

I did have the helper installed and correctly defined in config. \*ammm it, git!
In another desperate attempt, I checked for `GIT_ASKPASS` env. It wasn't set.
However, `SSH_ASKPASS` env was indeed set and pointed to the `x11-ssh-askpass` binary at the beginning.
I searched for the env in my NixOS config, there was not. It must've been set either by Git or NixOS.
If I unset the env and do `git push` then it promptly ask for my credential.

Anyway, I didn't care at that point. It shouldn't have asked for my credential in the beginning.
I mistakely cloned the https remote; So I changed the remote to the ssh one, pushed the update and called it a day.

title: Quitting mobile games

Lately, I've been playing mobile games to the point of addiction. I can already feel the negative effects on my physical/mental health and my academic performance. This lead me to the decision to stop playing mobile games altogether.

I've tried a few times in the past to no avail. I hope this time things will be different. Stuff like blocking the app locally or even block the game server didn't work as I can easily bypass them. I guess determination is what i need. Wish me luck =)
